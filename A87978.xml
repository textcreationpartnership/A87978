            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Thou didst talk as if <hi>Mercury</hi> had been thy Foot-post, and that thou hadst kept a Weekly Correspondence with the <hi>Coelum Empyreuna,</hi> or that the soul of <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragel</hi>

And now good Mr. <hi>Lilly, Sweet William,</hi> what are become of all your <hi>Alchodens, Triplicities, Benesicials</hi> and <hi>Maleficials,</hi> and your <hi>Genethliack Gimcracks,</hi> with more artificial Scrauls in 'um, than a Girle makes when she first learns to frame her Letters: Did you not erect a certain stately Structure of twelve Houses, and furnish them all at your own charges, with the Triumphs of your Patron? Come, come, do not deny it, 'tis very true, and you did therefore receive a Golden Sawcidge too to hang about your Illustrious shoulders. Pray what are become of all those gaudy Triumphs? Alas, they are all marcht off, with such a remarkable <hi>Sic transit,</hi> that never humane frailty so bejaded poor Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; And for thy part, methinks we now see thee with thy Dragons tayl clapt between thy legs, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Dog that hath stollen a Pudding, to see thy old friends the Stars leave thee thus thus in the sudds. You bid your Patron conquer, but alas! he was beaten. You bid him take <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> but the Royal Knave was sullen, and would not. You bid him live, but he, as if it had been to spite his Astrologer, doth the quite contrary, and dyes. Thus your brother Chald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ans told <hi>Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> how that they should not dye but in their full old age, and at home, and in peace, and untoucht in their honor; yet all men know their ends were quite otherwise, violent, immature, and tragical.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119370:4"/>
            <p>Therefore, O thou Worshipper of the Heathen gods, leave thy <hi>Canting,</hi> and thy <hi>Vaunting,</hi> and thy <hi>Flaunting;</hi> give over thy <hi>Predictions,</hi> and thy <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> thy <hi>Maledictions,</hi> and thy <hi>Fictions,</hi> that are neither <hi>Significal,</hi> nor <hi>Hieroglyphical,</hi> nor real, nor es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, but most Nonsensical and Excentrical from all truth that ever was, is, and shall be in this world and in the world to come. You may think to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loguing with us, and to that purpose be telling strange stories of our future happiness and good fortune; but good King of the <hi>Gypsies</hi> trouble not thy self, thou wilt lose thy labour we assure thee; thou getst no Gold Chains here, we defie thee and all thy Laplanders: Nor shall we keep a Servant that consults thee so much as upon the loss of a Silver Spoon. We are resolved to follow honest <hi>Horace</hi>'s advice to <hi>Leuconor,</hi> and to take things as they come; being fully satisfied in all thy <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Impostures. However, to shew thee that we have something of good wishes left for thee, as thou professest thy self to be a Christian, we advise thee to remember the stories of <hi>Diophantus</hi> and <hi>Gauricus,</hi> who brought themselves to their unforeseen ends, while they prophecy'd the Misfortunes of other men, and became sufferers of that which their own Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never had the good fortune to foreknow. This <hi>Gauricus</hi> was a Sycophant, and a great Medler with State affairs, but his end was sad: Thou art the same, therefore beware by other mens harms. Truly, we are afraid thou art a man very much lost in this world, and therefore that thou maist not be long in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy merited Reproaches, do as thy Brother <hi>Cardanus</hi> did; prophecy thou shalt die by such a time,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119370:4"/>but let it be very sudden; and if then thou dost not finde such an inclination to death as thou ought'st to have, starve thy self to verifie the Prediction. I know no other way for thee to regain thy own, and the lost Credit of thy scandalous Science. We could now bid you God b'w'ye, in the phrase of an Almanack, and say, <hi>Farewell Frost;</hi> but we are loth to offend thee too much: for we know thou dost not care to hear of <hi>his</hi> Memory. Therefore God rest his bones, for they had little rest when he taught thy friend religion. And if thou wilt take our advice, let God rest thy bones too, for thou hast taken a great deal of pains; thy Name's up, and thou maist even now go to bed and sleep. But if ever thou appearest again, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test any thing beyond Prescriptions for letting of blood, and sowing of Pot-herbs, Cursed be thou, and Cursed be all they that reade them. Which is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of him that never had any reason to be either</p>
